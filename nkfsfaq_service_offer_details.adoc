*What service levels does NetApp guarantee with the service?*
In a NetApp operated scenario, NetApp Keystone guarantees IOPS/TiB for the storage that is provisioned and the latency for each service level.

*What is the typical length of term of a Flex Subscription agreement?*
Flex Subscription offers 12, 24, and 36-month term periods.

*How can I access the storage?*
In a NetApp-operated (standard) model, the storage controllers (ONTAP System Manager or administrative access to the systems) are owned and managed by NetApp. You can monitor and manage your storage only through NetApp Service Engine UI and APIs.
In a customer-managed (or Lite) deployment, where the NetApp Service Engine UI and APIs are used mainly for billing functions, you can access the storage controllers, such as Active IQ Unified Manager and ONTAP System Manager, and directly access ONTAP clusters.

*How do I manage the service?*
NetApp Service Engine is the orchestration and management tool that you can use to provision storage and get reports on the service usage.

*Are APIs provided to integrate with customer tools?*
Yes, RESTful APIs are available to integrate into your own applications.

*Who does the monitoring and operations?*
For the NetApp-operated service, NetApp is responsible for monitoring the infrastructure remotely so that the service is delivered according to the agreed expectations.

For the partner-operated service, partner is responsible for monitoring the infrastructure remotely so that the service is delivered according to the agreed expectations.

For the customer-operated service, customer is responsible for monitoring the infrastructure and raise any issues to NetApp.

*What happens if I terminate the service early?*
The minimum service commitment is 12 months. If you cancel the service early, the residual value needs to be paid upfront.

*Is there an opportunity to convert into a purchase after the initial term is completed?*
No. The offer does not include an option to convert into a purchase. Additionally, previously purchased NetApp products are outside the scope of this program.
