The customer is responsible for providing PDUs, connected to two separate, protected circuits with sufficient C13 outlets. In the customer-operated offering, in some cases, C19 outlets are required. In the NetApp- operated offering, either NetApp or the customer can provide the PDUs, depending on requirements.
