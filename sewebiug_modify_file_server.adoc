You can make the following changes to an existing server:

. Change the server name
. Make the server CIFS-enabled, and specify the Active Directory user name and password, Active Directory domain, DNS Server, Server name and optionally the Active Directory Organizational Unit. The Active Directory credentials must be for a user that has the privilege to join a computer to the Active Directory domain.
. Enable asynchronous disaster recovery DP by specifying a region or zone to replicate the server to.

[NOTE]
If asynchronous disaster recovery is already enabled, it cannot be disabled. For more information, see link:sewebiug_billing_accounts,_subscriptions,_services,_and_performance.html#disaster-recovery[Disaster recovery].

=== Steps

. Locate the server in the list and click the Edit icon for that server. (For details about working with items in lists, see link:sewebiug_netapp_service_engine_web_interface_overview.html#list-view[List view actions]).
. Make any changes as required; refer to link:sewebiug_create_a_file_server.html[Create a file server] for field descriptions.
. Click Done. This creates a job to modify the server.
