There are three operational models in Flex Subscriptions. These FAQs are related to those operational models.

=== What are the different operating models and who is responsible for the major activities?

The following chart is an overview of the three operating models that a customer can select: NetApp Operated, Partner Operated, and Customer Operated.

* *NetApp-operated model*: The end to end management of installation, deployment, operations, monitoring, optimization and support is performed by NetApp.
* *Partner-operated model*: The share of roles and responsibilities depends on the SLA between you and the service provider or partner. Contact your service provider for information.
* *Customer-operated model*: The following table summarizes the overall service lifecycle model and the roles and responsibilities associated with them in a customer-operated environment.

=== What is a NetApp-operated model?

This operating model allows the customer to subscribe to the offered services, according to the selected performance tiers and storage service types and selects the NetApp operated option at an extra cost. NetApp defines the architecture and products, installs at the customer premises, and NetApp manages the day-to-day infrastructure management operations using our storage and IT resources. Available storage service types are file, block (iSCSI), and object. Cloud Volumes Service for GCP and AWS are also supported.

NetApp also creates and manages the partners, tenants, as applicable, and manages the subscriptions.

=== What is a partner-operated model?

The operating model for the partner or service provider is similar to the NetApp-operated model, but with the partner operating the service for their end customer. In this model, the partner is the referenced contracted party. Tenants are customers of the service providers and have no billing relationship with NetApp. They manage their tenancy and customers. The tenants support requests are first triaged by the service provider before being escalated to NetApp.

=== What is a customer-operated model?

This operating model allows the customer to subscribe to an offered service, according to the selected performance tiers and storage service types. NetApp defines the architecture and products and installs at the customer premises and allows customers to manage the infrastructure using their storage and IT resources. Available storage service types are file, block (iSCSI), and object. In this model, the customer referenced the contracted party, and this can be an end-user or partner.

=== Who owns the equipment?

In all three operating models, NetApp owns the title to all the hardware and software installed at the customer premises.
