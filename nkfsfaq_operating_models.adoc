*What is a NetApp-operated model?*

This operating model allows the customer to subscribe to the offered services, according to the selected performance tiers and storage service types and selects the NetApp operated option at an extra cost. NetApp defines the architecture and products, installs at the customer premises, and NetApp manages the day-to-day infrastructure management operations using our storage and IT resources. Available storage service types are file, block (iSCSI), and object.

*What is a partner-operated model?*

The operating model for the partner is similar to the NetApp- operated model, but with the partner operating the service for their end customer. In this model, the partner is the referenced contracted party.

*What is a customer-operated model?*

This operating model allows the customer to subscribe to an offered service, according to the selected performance tiers and storage service types. NetApp defines the architecture and products and installs at the customer premises and allows customers to manage the infrastructure using their storage and IT resources. Available storage service types are file, block (iSCSI), and object. In this model, the customer referenced the contracted party, and this can be an end-user or partner.

*Who owns the equipment?*

In all three operating models, NetApp owns the title to all the hardware and software installed at the customer premises.
