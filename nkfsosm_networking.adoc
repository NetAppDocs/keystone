Depending on customer requirements and the storage controllers used, NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription can provide 10 Gb, 40 Gb, and 100 Gb connectivity to the customer.

NetApp will provide the required transceivers for NetApp-provided Keystone devices only. The customer is responsible for suppling transceivers required for customer devices and cabling to the NetApp-provided Keystone devices.
