You can change the share name, the share type (CIFS, NFS, multi-protocol), service level, capacity, snapshot policy, export policy,  and tags.

[NOTE]
Using this method,  you can move your shares to different performance levels if available.

=== Before you begin

The file share must be in the operational state.

=== Steps

. Display the link:sewebiug_view_shares.html#view-shares[Shares list].
. Locate the share in the list and click the Edit icon for that share. (For details about working with items in lists,  see link:sewebiug_netapp_service_engine_web_interface_overview.html#list-view[List view actions]).
. Make any changes as required;  for field descriptions, see link:sewebiug_create_a_new_file_share.html[Create a new file share].
. Click Done. This creates a job to modify the share.

=== After you finish

Modify share is run as an link:sewebiug_billing_accounts,_subscriptions,_services,_and_performance.html#disaster-recoveryâ€”asynchronous[asynchronous job]. You can:

* Check the status of the job in the jobs list.
* After the job is finished, check the status of the share in the Shares list.
