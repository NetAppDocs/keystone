The NetApp Service Engine web portal allows you to manage and monitor a NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription (Flex Subscription) service. The portal consists of the following components:

* A graphical user interface (NetApp Service Engine web interface) that supports monitoring and simple storage provisioning. The menu options on the user interface (UI) are available based on the services and subscriptions of the tenant and subtenant.
* A set of REST APIs that allow more advanced setup and storage management actions. This guide describes how to use the NetApp Service Engine web interface. Functionality that is only available through the REST APIs is not covered in this document.

This section describes the NetApp Service Engine concepts and elements.

=== Key NetApp Service Engine concepts

NetApp Service Engine supports the concepts of regions and zones. A region represents a data center or site, while a zone represents a storage subunit within the region (technically a cluster within a data center or site). Multiple zones support data availability and data protection (DP) features.

A single NetApp Service Engine instance can support one or more tenants. NetApp Service Engine uses the concepts of tenant and subtenant as hierarchical entities that own or manage the storage service.

A tenant can be a customer, partner, or a billing entity. A tenant holds the subscription (or multiple subscriptions) to the Flex Subscription service.

A subtenant is an entity wholly within the tenant. It can be used for show back, security separation, and so on.

Storage items are created per subtenant. Each subtenant can hold multiple storage items of the type and number suitable for that subtenant.

NetApp Service Engine supports the following types of storage:

* Block storage in block stores and disks
* File storage in file servers and file shares
* Object storage in buckets
