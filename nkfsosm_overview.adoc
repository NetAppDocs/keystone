NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription (Flex Subscription) offers three operational models for service delivery.

* *NetApp-operated model* allows the customer to subscribe to the offered services (according to the selected performance tiers and storage service types) and selects the NetApp-operated option at an extra cost. NetApp defines the architecture and products, installs at the customer premises, and manages the day-to-day infrastructure management operations by using NetApp storage and IT resources. Available storage service types are file, block, and object. Storage subscriptions based on Cloud Volumes Service for GCP and AWS can also be managed through your NetApp Keystone instance.
* *Partner-operated* *model* is similar to the NetApp-operated model, but with the partner operating the service for their end customers. In this model, the partner is the referenced contracted party. Tenants are customers of partners or service providers and have no billing relationship with NetApp. A partner-operated model usually has a multi-tenant environment where end customers/tenants have their own subscriptions that are billed by the service provider/partner. The partner admin performs the administrative tasks for all the tenants. The functions that an admin can perform in a partner-operated model are different from that of an admin in a NetApp-operated model.
* *Customer-operated* *model* allows the customer to subscribe to an offered service, according to the selected performance tiers and storage service types. NetApp defines the architecture and products and installs at the customer premises and allows customers to manage the infrastructure using their storage and IT resources. A customer can be tied to NetApp or a partner/service provider, and based on that, the service requests can be raised and addressed to NetApp or the service provider. A customer admin can perform the administrative tasks in a customer-operated environment. These tasks are tied to the tenants and subtenants for the specific customer.

The features and options in the offering vary based on the models. For information, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/keystone/sewebiug_partner_service_provider.html[Roles and operations of service providers and customers]
