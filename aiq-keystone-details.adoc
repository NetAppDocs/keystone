The Active IQ Digital Advisor (Digital Advisor) dashboard provides you with the capability of monitoring the usage pertaining to your NetApp Keystone subscriptions and generating reports. On subscribing to Keystone services, you can view the details of your subscription and usage on the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget on the Digital Advisor dashboard.

[NOTE]
The information available here applies to both ONTAP and StorageGRID. Exceptions have been pointed out in the relevant sections.

For information about the Keystone Digital Advisor widget, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/view_keystone_capacity_utilization.html[View capacity utilization with NetApp Keystone Subscription^].

To view the details, perform the following steps:

.Steps

. On Digital Advisor, click *View More Details* on the widget to view the usage details and alerts on your volumes on the *Keystone Subscriptions* page. Alternately, from the left navigation pane, go to *GENERAL > Keystone Subscriptions*.

The details of the subscriptions, usage charts for each service level, and volume details are displayed in the different tabs on the *Keystone Subscriptions* screen.

[NOTE]
Capacity consumption in Keystone subscriptions is displayed in TiBs on the dashboards and reports, up to two decimal places. If the usage is less than 0.01 TiB, then the value is shown as `0` or `No Usage`. For other usage metrics, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/keystone/nkfsosm_service_level_metrics_and_definitions.html[Service level metrics and definitions]. For information about different capacities used in Keystone, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/keystone/nkfsosm_keystone_service_capacity_definitions.html[Keystone service capacity definitions].

== View subscription details
You can view all the subscriptions for an account name in the *Subscription Details* tab.

For each subscription number, you can see the following information:

* *Subscription Number*: The subscription number of the Keystone subscription assigned by NetApp.
* *Tracking ID*: The tracking ID assigned at the time of subscription activation. This is a unique ID for each subscription and site, used for tracking the subscription.
* *Billing Period*: The billing period of the subscription, such as monthly, quarterly, or annual.
* *Start Date*: The start date of the subscription.
* *End date*: The end date of the subscription. Based on this date, you might see information messages for subscriptions that are nearing expiry.
* *Usage Status*: Indicates how much of the subscription has been used or overused. You can sort the list by this column if you want to view the highest consumption records.
* image:aiq-ks-time-icon.png[]: Clicking this icon opens the *Subscription Time Series* tab where you can see the historical usage data for each service level included in this subscription.

You can see more details by clicking the downward arrow for a subscription record. Details, such as the service level name, committed, consumed, available capacities, and current and accrued burst usage are displayed in TiB. Specific service levels that record higher consumption are highlighted. Any warnings and alerts generated for your volumes are also displayed.

For information about your Keystone storage services and the relevant service levels, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/keystone/nkfsosm_performance.html[Service levels].

You can refer to the following usage indicators to check the usage status of each subscription:

image:usage-indicator.png[]

.Index

image:icon-grey.png[]: No capacity usage recorded against the committed capacity of the service level
image:icon-green.png[]: The consumption is normal, within 80% of the committed capacity
image:icon-amber.png[]: Maximum consumption, that is, the usage is about to reach 100% or more of the committed capacity. The *Consumed* column displays this indicator for any consumption above 80% of the committed capacity
image:icon-red.png[]: The consumption is within the burst limit. The burst consumption is the consumption that tops the 100% committed capacity of a service level, and is within the agreed-upon burst usage limit, such as 120%
image:icon-purple.png[]: Indicates consumption above the stipulated burst limit

== View historical subscription data
The *Subscription Time Series* tab displays historical data of your subscriptions for a specific period. The vertical graphs display the usage details for the selected time range with appropriate indicators for you to compare and generate reports. 

.Steps
. Click the *Subscription Time Series* tab.
. Select the required subscription for which you want to view the details. The first subscription in your account name is selected by default.
. Select the time range from the calendar icons in the *From Date* and *To Date* fields. The default time range is from the start date of the billing period to the current date.
. Click *View Details*. The historical consumption data of the subscription for each service level is displayed based on the selected time range. You can hover your mouse cursor over the charts to view the usage breakdown in terms of committed, consumed, burst, and above the burst limit data at that data point.

image:aiq-ks-subtime-2.png[]

The following details are displayed:

* *Subscription details*: The start and end date of the subscription, and the billing period, for example, quarterly, yearly, and so forth.
* *Usage charts*: The bar charts display the service level name and the capacity consumed against that service level for the date range. The date and time of the collection are displayed at the bottom of the chart.
+
[NOTE]
Based on the date range of your query, the usage charts are displayed in a range of 30 data points.
+
The following colors in the bar charts indicate the consumed capacity as defined within the service level:

** Green: Within 80%.
** Amber: 80% - 100%.
** Red: Burst usage (100% of the committed capacity to the agreed burst limit)
** Purple: Above the burst limit or `Above Limit`.
** Grey: _Provisional usage_ - usage recorded when the exact data for the time period is unavailable and is substituted by the data available at the previous data collection point.
* *Current Consumed*: Indicator for the consumed capacity (in TiB) defined for the service level. This field uses specific colors for usage:
** Grey: None.
** Green: Within 80% of the committed capacity.
** Amber: Any consumption above 80% of the committed capacity.
* *Current Burst*: Indicator for the consumed capacity within or above the defined burst limit. Any usage within the burst limit agreed upon, for example, 20% above the committed capacity is within the burst limit. Further usage is considered as usage above the burst limit. This field uses specific colors for usage:
** Grey: None.
** Red: Burst.
** Purple: Above the burst limit.
* *Accrued Burst*: Indicator for the accrued burst usage or consumed capacity calculated per month for the current billing period. The accrued burst usage is calculated based on the committed and consumed capacity for a service level: `(consumed - committed)/365.25/12`.
+
[NOTE]
The *Current Consumed*, *Current Burst*, and *Accrued Burst* indicators determine the consumption with respect to the billing period of the subscription, and are not based on the date range of the query.

== View system details

. Select the date range for the query.

You can view and compare the performance metrics in the following sections based on the combination of the subscription number, volume name, and the date range selected. The details are displayed as per service level assigned to the volume. You can see the cluster name and volume type, that is, the read and write permissions assigned to the volume. Any warning message associated with the volume is also displayed.

[NOTE]
The retrieved details are based on the service level objective for each service level. For example, the peak IOPS, maximum throughput, target latency, and other metrics are determined by the individual settings for the service level. For more information about the settings, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/keystone/nkfsosm_performance.html[Service levels]. 

The performance data displayed on the horizontal graph is averaged out every 5 minutes and arranged as per the date range of the query. You can scroll across the graphs and hover your mouse over specific data points to drill further down into the collected data. You can view the _provisional data_ when the exact usage data is unavailable at that point and is substituted by the data available at the previous data collection point.

=== IOPS/TiB
This section displays the input-output graphs for the workloads in the volume based on the date range of the query. The peak IOPS for the service level and the current IOPS (in the last five minutes, not based on the date range of the query) are displayed, along with the minimum, maximum, and average IOPS for the time range, in IOPS/TiB.

image:perf-iops.png[]

=== Throughput (MBps/TiB)
This section displays the throughput graphs for the workloads in the volume based on the date range of the query. The maximum throughput for the service level (SLO Max), and current throughput (in the last five minutes, not based on the date range of the query) are displayed, along with the minimum, maximum, and average throughput for the time range, in MBps/TiB.

image:perf-thr.png[]

=== Latency (ms)
This section displays the latency graphs for the workloads in the volume based on the date range of the query. The maximum latency for service level (SLO Target), and current latency (in the last five minutes, not based on the date range of the query) are displayed, along with the minimum, maximum, and average latency for the time range, in milliseconds.

This graph has the following colors:

* Light blue: _Latency_. This is the actual latency that includes any latency other than your Keystone service. This might include additional latency, such as the latency occurring between your network and client.
* Dark blue: _Effective latency_. Effective latency is the latency applicable only to your Keystone service with respect to your SLA.

image:perf-lat.png[]

=== Logical Used (TiB)
This section displays the provisioned and the logical used capacities of the volume. The current logical used capacity (in the last five minutes, not based on the date range of the query), along with the minimum, maximum, and average usage for the time range are displayed in TiBs. On this graph, the grey area represents the committed capacity, and the yellow graph indicates the logical use.
