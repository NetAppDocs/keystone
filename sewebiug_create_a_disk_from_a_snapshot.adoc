This section describes how to create a new disk from a snapshot. The process can use an existing snapshot or can create an immediate adhoc snapshot that will be used for the cloning operation. For information about:

* How to create a new disk directly (see link:sewebiug_create_a_new_disk.html#create-a-new-disk[Create a new disk])
* Snapshots (see link:sewebiug_view_disks.html#[Create a disk from a snapshot])

=== Steps

.. Locate the disk in the list, click the Create disk from the snapshot icon and then go to step 4.
. Select the disk containing the snapshot to clone by selecting checkbox in the Select column, then click *Next*.

[NOTE]
Filter the list by region, zone, and subtenant to quickly locate the disk in the list.

+
. To use an existing snapshot, select the snapshot to clone; you can filter the list by schedule type or search for the snapshot by name (partial matches accepted).
+
[NOTE]
To create a new snapshot, do not select a snapshot.

+
. Click *Next*.
. If the disk has no snapshot, a snapshot will be created as you proceed. Enter the new disk name and disk path and select an operating system type.
. Review the other selections that are inherited from the snapshot and select or amend as required. For field descriptions, see link:sewebiug_create_a_new_disk.html#create-a-new-disk[Create a new disk]).
. Click *Create*. This creates a job to create the clone with the specified settings.

=== After you finish

Create disk is run as an link:sewebiug_billing_accounts,_subscriptions,_services,_and_performance.html#disaster-recoveryâ€”asynchronous[asynchronous job]. You can:

* Check the status of the job in the jobs list.
* After the job is finished, check the status of the disk in the Disks list.
