This section describes how to delete a file share.

*Attention:*

* You cannot undo deletion of a share. After it is deleted, data cannot be recovered.
* Deleting a primary file share will delete all associated backups

=== Steps

. Display the link:sewebiug_view_shares.html#view-shares[Shares list].
. Locate the share in the list and click the Delete icon for that share. (For details about working with items in lists, see link:sewebiug_netapp_service_engine_web_interface_overview.html#list-view[List view actions]).
. In the Confirm Delete dialog box, enter the file share name to confirm that you want to delete the file share.

. Click Confirm. This creates a job to delete the share.

=== After you finish

Delete share is run as an asynchronous job <xref>. You can:

* Check the status of the job in the jobs list.
* After the job is finished, verify that the share has been removed from the Shares list.
