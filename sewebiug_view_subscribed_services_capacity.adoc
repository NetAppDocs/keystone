The Dashboard page displays information about the storage subscriptions for a specific subscription number. For the selected subscription, the dashboard displays the service tiers that make up the selected subscription. It also displays the capacity usage for each service level, and for add-on services, such as data protection and advanced protection, in additional tabs.

=== Dashboard view for a service provider

The dashboard provides a high-level overview of the NetApp Keystone Flex Subscriptions. As a service provider/partner you can view the service levels for your subscription, any add-on services in other tabs, the tenant subscriptions under each subscription. You can also have a view of the data usage (such as burst data) by each tenant, and can filter the usage based on a specific tenant (by selecting a specific tenant from the top right corner).

Each service that you have subscribed to, as a service provider, is represented by a circle consisting of four concentric rings. The rings depict the capacities associated with the service: the outer ring depicts the capacity that has been committed for the tenants. The middle blue ring depicts the capacity is actually consumed by the tenants under that subscription. The inner ring indicates of any burst capacity usage (in red). The innermost area gives an overview of the total capacity under Flex Subscription service that you have subscribed to. Hover the cursor over the ring to view the relevant capacity.

When a service provider has more than one subscription, they can scroll down to view the subscribed services of the other subscriptions.

For a tenant administrator, you can view only the current details of all the tenant subscriptions for your tenancy - the service levels for your subscription and any add-on services in other tabs.
