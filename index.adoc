Flex Subscription is a subscription-based service offering that provides storage capacity, at predefined performance service levels, for block, file, and object data types that can be deployed on-premises and can be operated by NetApp, a partner, or the customer. In addition to the base service that Flex Subscription provides, add-on services can be chosen at an additional cost. These services are described in the below figure.

* *Data Protection Basic* service provides NetApp SnapMirror and NetApp SnapVault capabilities with default settings.
* *Data Protection Advanced* provides a service with SLAs of RPO=0 by leveraging the NetApp MetroCluster capabilities.

[NOTE]
NetApp Keystone uses SnapVault technology for backup operations and SnapMirror for disaster recovery to replicate the data remotely; it does not automatically fail over and restore applications.
