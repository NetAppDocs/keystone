NetApp Service Engine provides a set of APIs to manage storage resources on the supported storage systems through a RESTful web service interface for any third-party integration. The APIs cover all the functionalities that are supported through the GUI. NetApp provides the API documentation, but it is the customerâ€™s responsibility to integrate into their applications.

This NetApp Service Engine API Reference Guide provides you with information about APIs and sample codes. The information provided in the guide enables you to create RESTful clients of NetApp Service Engine. The APIs are based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

=== Target audience

This guide is intended for developers creating applications that interface with the NetApp Service Engine software through REST APIs.

You should use this guide if you want to use the storage provider, NetApp ONTAP cluster, and management administration APIs for managing your storage.

=== NetApp Service Engine API access and categories

==== Constructing a URL to directly access REST APIs

You can access the REST APIs directly through a programming language, such as Python, C#, C++, JavaScript, and so on. To access the REST APIs in the `https:// <hostname> /api` format, enter the host name or IP address and the URL.

==== Consumer and administrator APIs

This document splits the API descriptions into two sections consisting of:

* Consumer APIs
* Administrator APIs

=== Key NetApp Service Engine concepts

NetApp Service Engine supports the concepts of regions and zones, as shown in figure below. A region represents a data center or site, while a zone represents a storage subunit within the region (technically, a cluster within a data center/site). Multiple zones support data availability and data protection (DP) features.

A single NetApp Service Engine instance can support one or more tenants. NetApp Service Engine uses the concepts of tenant and subtenant as hierarchical entities that own or manage the storage service.

A tenant can be a customer, partner, or a billing entity. A tenant holds the subscription (or multiple subscriptions) to the Keystone storage service.

A subtenant is an entity wholly within the tenant. It can be used for showback, security separation, and so on.

Storage items are created per subtenant. Each subtenant can hold multiple storage items of the type and number suitable for that subtenant.

NetApp Service Engine supports the following types of storage:

* Block storage in block stores and disks
* File storage in file servers and file shares
* Object storage in buckets
