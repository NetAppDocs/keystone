The following known issues have been reported in this release of NetApp Service Engine.


|===
|Known Issue |Description |Workaround

|Limitations in synchronous data protection
|There is an issue where the VLANs, IPspaces, and Broadcast domains are not defined on the secondary partner of an MetroCluster cluster. This issue can affect recovery of data from the replica zone.
|Place a service request for GSSC to perform a manual network configuration on the partner cluster. The network configuration can be done in advance if the network components (VLAN, IPspace, and Broadcast domains) are known.
|Limitations in disabling and deleting volumes that are disaster-recovery enabled
|If there are two or more volumes in a storage VM that are disaster-recovery enabled, disaster-recovery cannot be disabled for a file share or disk.
|Raise a service request for a clean deletion or disabling of these volumes.
|Limitation in editing or deleting backup policy
|A backup policy, once enabled, cannot be modified or deleted.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to modify or remove the backup policy.
|Disaster-recovery enabled file shares or disks to be created at an interval of 15 minutes
|When disaster-recovery enabled file shares or disks are created at short intervals, the created volumes have a status of "Contact support". This happens due to the transfer status of the storage VM configuration.
|Create volumes at an interval of around 15 minutes ensure that the storage VM configuration is transferred.
