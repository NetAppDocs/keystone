The following known issues have been reported in NetApp Service Engine. You might encounter these issues when you provision or use your storage as a part of your Flex Subscription.

|Known Issue |Description |Workaround

|Limitations in synchronous data protection
|There is an issue where the VLANs, IPspaces, and Broadcast domains are not defined on the secondary partner of an MetroCluster cluster. This issue can affect recovery of data from the replica zone.
|Place a service request for GSSC to perform a manual network configuration on the partner cluster. The network configuration can be done in advance if the network components (VLAN, IPspace, and Broadcast domains) are known.
|Limitations in disabling and deleting volumes that are disaster recovery enabled
|If there are two or more volumes in a storage VM that are disaster recovery enabled, disaster recovery cannot be disabled for a file share or disk.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|Limitations in deleting file servers and block stores that are disaster recovery enabled
|Deleting a disaster recovery enabled block store or file share might fail because peering is not removed due to timeout.
|Failed deletion is available in “Contact Support” and Support will be notified via OpsRamp Ticket.
|Limitation when creating multiple snapshots
|When multiple snapshots are triggered for creation, the web page initially displays only the last snapshot issued.
|Auto job picks up the other snapshots within 15 minutes.
|Disaster recovery enabled file servers on the secondary controllers are not deleted.
|All primary volumes and the replication relationships are removed. However, the disaster recovery object is not deleted. This object does not consume any capacity or networking.
|There is no workaround for this issue.
|Limitation in disabling backup on volumes
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|There is no workaround for this issue.
|Limitation in deleting network subnets
|Customers are unable to delete network subnets.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|Limitation in deleting VLAN using API
|Deleting a VLAN that has a subnet associated with it leaves an empty subnet stub in the UI.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|Limitation in importing storage VMs with non-standard subnet
|Storage VMs (storage virtual machines, also known as SVMs), created outside of NetApp Service Engine cannot be operational due to a non-standard subnet. The storage VMs are imported with the status `Contacted Support`.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|Capacity and billing reports might be inaccurate in NetApp-managed environments
|In a NetApp-managed environment, the capacity and billing reports generated from the UI might be affected due to missing LUN size metrics and service levels on backup volumes.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
a|
A 15-minute lag in reporting the committed capacity on graphs after subscription creation.
a|
When a tenant subscription is created, and the report graphs are checked immediately (within 15 minutes of the subscription creation), the committed capacity is not reported correctly.
a|
Check the report graphs at least 15 minutes after the subscription is created.
a|
Change in performance service levels does not move volumes
a|
If two different aggregates in the same cluster are used for two service levels, changing the service level on a volume to another does not move the volume to the other aggregate. Only the adaptive QoS policy is applied.
a|
Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
a|
Creation of FCP SVM requires iSCSI activation
a|
For creating a storage virtual machine (SVM) and enabling FCP support on it, an iSCSI interface activation is required.
a|
Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
a|
Limitation with multiple host groups with same initiator
a|
If multiple host groups are created with the same initiator name, and disks are mapped to all the host groups, the disks get mapped to only one host group on the cluster.
a|
Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
