|Known Issue |Description |Workaround

|Limitations in synchronous data protection
|There is an issue where the VLANs, IPspaces, and Broadcast domains are not defined on the secondary partner of an MetroCluster cluster. This issue can affect recovery of data from the replica zone.
|Place a service request for GSSC to perform a manual network configuration on the partner cluster. The network configuration can be done in advance if the network components (VLAN, IPspace, and Broadcast domains) are known.
|Limitations in disabling and deleting volumes that are disaster recovery enabled
|If there are two or more volumes in a storage VM that are disaster recovery enabled, disaster recovery cannot be disabled for a file share or disk.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|Limitations in deleting file servers and block stores that are disaster recovery enabled
|Deleting a disaster recovery enabled block store or file share might fail because peering is not removed due to timeout.
|Failed deletion is available in “Contact Support” and Support will be notified via OpsRamp Ticket.
|Limitations for long running jobs placed in "Queued” state.
|When jobs run for an extended time, they are placed in the “Queued” state. A support ticket has to be raised to identify the issue.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|Limitation when creating multiple snapshots
|When multiple snapshots are triggered for creation, the web page initially displays only the last snapshot issued.
|Auto job picks up the other snapshots within 15 minutes.
|Disaster recovery enabled file servers on the secondary controllers are not deleted.
|All primary volumes and the replication relationships are removed. However, the disaster recovery object is not deleted. This object does not consume any capacity or networking.
|There is no workaround for this issue.
|Limitation in disabling backup on volumes
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|There is no workaround for this issue.
|Limitation with deleting network subnets
|Customers are unable to delete network subnets.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|Limitation in deleting VLAN using API
|Deleting a VLAN that has a subnet associated with it leaves an empty subnet stub in the UI.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|Limitation with creation of storage VM from imported subnet
|Storage VMs (storage virtual machines, also known as SVMs), created outside of NetApp Service Engine cannot be imported due to a non-standard subnet. The storage VMs are imported with the status `Contacted Support`.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
|Capacity and billing reports might be inaccurate in NetApp-managed environments
|In a NetApp-managed environment, the capacity and billing reports generated from the UI might be affected due to missing LUN size metrics and service levels on backup volumes.
|Raise a service request for GSSC to resolve the issue.
