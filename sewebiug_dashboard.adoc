The Dashboard provides a quick overview of your NetApp Keystone storage subscriptions. It displays information about the capacity used, billing against your usage, recent alerts, and service requests.

The Dashboard displays important information across the following widgets, which can be clicked through for in-depth analysis:

* *Capacity Utilization:* Displays your capacity utilization for your subscribed services, for example, Keystone Flex Subscription, Keystone Flex Utility, and Cloud Services. Clicking a horizontal bar graph takes you to the broken-up utilization charts for each service level. You can view the unused, consumed, and burst usage for each service level and your add-on services, such as data protection and advanced protection. It helps you identify if you need to add more capacity to your subscriptions, or whether to opt for a different service level.
[NOTE]
[2.6.2]The capacity utilization data is regenerated every 15 minutes. You can use the refresh icon on the top of the dashboard refreshed the data at intervals.

* *Costs to Date (Billing):* This section is available based on your partner-administrator rights. It displays the aggregated monthly charges for all your subscriptions. You can view the billing details for the last four months. On hovering your cursor over the chart, you can view the charges split up as per your committed and burst usage. If you have multiple subscriptions for a subscribed service, on clicking the bar chart for a month, the subscription list is displayed on the Billing screen.
