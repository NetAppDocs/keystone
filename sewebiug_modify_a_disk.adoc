You can change the disk name, the host group mapping, performance service level, capacity, and snapshot policy.

Using this method, you can move your disks to different performance levels if available.

=== Before you begin

The disk must be in an operational state.

=== Steps

. Display the link:sewebiug_view_disks.html#view-disks[Disks list].
. Locate the disk in the list and click the Edit icon for that disk. (For details about working with items in lists, see link:sewebiug_netapp_service_engine_web_interface_overview.html#list-view[List view actions]).
. Make any changes as required; refer to link:sewebiug_create_a_new_disk.html[Create a new disk] for field descriptions.
. Click *Done*. This creates a job to modify the disk.

=== After you finish

Modify disk is run as an link:sewebiug_billing_accounts,_subscriptions,_services,_and_performance.html#disaster-recoveryâ€”asynchronous[asynchronous job]. You can:

* Check the status of the job in the jobs list.
* After the job is finished, check the status of the disk in the Disks list.
