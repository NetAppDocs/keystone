You can use the NetApp Service Engine web portal to manage and monitor a NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription storage service in a NetApp, partner, or customer-operated model. The portal consists of the following features:

* A graphical interface (NetApp Service Engine web interface) that supports monitoring and simple storage provisioning.
* A set of Keystone REST APIs that allow more advanced setup and storage management actions.

The NetApp Service Engine portal is a single interface that allows customers to perform the following tasks:

* Subscription dashboard. View status of subscribed capacity and how much is being consumed.
* Storage provisioning. Workflows to create your NFS/CIFS file shares, FC/iSCSI disks, and S3 bucket.
* Data protection. Create snapshots and set backup policy or data replication on the provisioned file share or disk.
* Reports. View file shares and disks inventory and also trend on capacity usage against different service levels.
* Manage subscription. Order additional capacity to an existing subscription or a new service through the portal.
* Submit service requests or support issues and view their status

The complete functionality of NetApp Service Engine is available only in the NetApp-operated model. In a customer or partner-operated model, the NetApp Service Engine functionalities are limited to reporting and subscription management.
