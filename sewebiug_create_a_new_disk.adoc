This section describes how to create a new disk by directly specifying the disk details. For instructions on how to create a disk based on a Snapshot of an existing disk, see link:sewebiug_create_a_disk_from_a_snapshot.html#create-a-disk-from-a-snapshot[Create a disk from a Snapshot].

.Before you begin

* If block storage is available but not initialized, you will be asked to initialize it before you can create the disk. To initialize the block store, you need:
** The subnet for the block store. If you are not familiar with your network environment, please check with you IT department for the relevant values.
** The protocol to be used. By default, block stores have the iSCSI service enabled. Ensure that the subnet has already been created to initialize block storage services (iSCSI) for the subtenant in the specified zone. You can optionally enable the FCP service if the infrastructure allows it.
** The disaster recovery region, zone, and schedule if you want to enable asynchronous disaster recovery DP for the disk. For more information, see link:sewebiug_billing_accounts,_subscriptions,_services,_and_performance.html#disaster-recovery[Disaster recovery].
* Identify or define the host groups to be mapped to the disk. You can also create a host group as part of the disk creation.
* To enable asynchronous disaster recovery DP options for the disk, you must create the disk on a block store that is asynchronous disaster recovery enabled. For more information, see link:sewebiug_billing_accounts,_subscriptions,_services,_and_performance.html#disaster-recovery[Disaster recovery].
* To enable synchronous disaster recovery for a disk, create the disk in a zone that is MetroCluster-enabled.
* You can define a backup policy to capture backups of the disk on a scheduled basis. For more information, see link:sewebiug_billing_accounts,_subscriptions,_services,_and_performance.html#backups[Backups].

.Steps

. View the link:sewebiug_view_disks.html#view-disks[Disks list].
. Click *Create Disk*.
. In the Create Disk dialog box, select Create New Disk.
+

+
The Create Disk page is displayed.
+
. Select the protocol for accessing the disk: iSCSI or FCP.
. Select the subtenant, region, and zone, and subtenant for the new disk. The block store details for the selected region, zone, and subtenant display.
. If block storage is not enabled in the selected zone for the selected subtenant, a message displays to initialize it.
+

+
. Click *Initialize Block Storage*.
. In the Initialize Block Storage dialog box:
.. In the iSCSI panel, mandatorily specify the subnet.
The iSCSI service is enabled for all disks by default.
.. If required, enable the FCP protocol (only available if the underlying infrastructure supports it).
.. If required, enable the Asynchronous Disaster Recovery options (enable and select Region, Zone, and Schedule).
.. If the zone selected is MCC-enabled, the Synchronous Disaster Recovery toggle is enabled and cannot be disabled. Disks created in this block store synchronously replicate to the zone displayed in the Synchronous Disaster Recovery panel.
.. Click *Create* to initialize the block store. Wait until the block store initializes. The display returns to Create Disk page.
. Complete the following fields:
+
|===
|Field |Description

|Name
|Enter the disk name.
|Disk Path
|Enter the path for the disk.
|OS Type
|Select an operating system for the disk.
|Host Groups
|This list displays existing host groups that match the protocol, OS type, subtenant and zone selected for the disk.
Select one or more host groups.
To define a new host group, see the next step.
|===

. If required, create a new host group:
.. Click *Create Host Group*. The Create Host Group dialog is displayed.
.. Specify the Name of the host group.
.. Add the Initiators for the group. For each initiator, specify the alias and the initiator.
.. If required, add tags (key-value pairs) to the host group in the Tags section.
.. Click *Create*. The system creates the host group and displays a message when it is successfully created.
.. To map the newly created host group to the disk, go to the Host Groups field and select it.
. Select a performance service level.
+
Select an option to view the performance details for that level (as peak/expected IOPS/throughput). Select the service level that best matches your needs.

. Specify the capacity of the disk.
. If Snapshots are required for this disk:
.. Toggle to enable the Snapshot Policy to view the Snapshot Policy fields.
.. Specify when to create the Snapshots:

** *Hourly.* Specify which minute (of the hour) to take Snapshot (check) and the number of hourly Snapshots to retain.
** *Daily.* Specify when (hour and minute) to take the Snapshot (check) and the number of hourly Snapshots to retain. If you want to specify multiple hours when the Snapshot has to be taken daily, you can add the values of the hours in a comma-separated list, for example, 5, 10, 15, and so forth.
** *Weekly.* Specify when (day of the week, hour and minute) to take Snapshot (check) and the number of weekly Snapshots to retain.
** *Monthly.* Specify when (day of the month, hour, and minute) to take Snapshot and the number of monthly snapshots to retain.
. If asynchronous disaster recovery is enabled on the underlying block store, asynchronous disaster recovery replication is automatically enabled for the new disk. If you wish to exclude the disk from asynchronous disaster recovery replications, toggle the Asynchronous Disaster Recovery toggle so that asynchronous disaster recovery is disabled.
. If the disk is being created in a zone that is MetroCluster-enabled, the Synchronous Disaster Recovery button is enabled and cannot be disabled. The disk will be replicated to the zone displayed in the Synchronous Disaster Recovery panel.
. To enable backups for this disk:
.. Toggle to enable the Backup Policy to view the Backup Policy fields.
.. Specify the backup zone.
.. Specify how many of each type of backup to keep: daily, weekly, and/or monthly.
. If you want to add tags (key-value pairs) to the disk, specify them in the Tags section.
. Click *Create*. This creates a job to create the disk.

.After you finish

Create disk is run as an asynchronous job. You can:

* Check the status of the job in the jobs list.
* After the job is finished, check the status of the disk in the Disks list.
