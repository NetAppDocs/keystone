In the event of an unplanned outage on NetApp services, NetApp will take the following actions:

* NetApp will manage the major incident with the level of attention deemed appropriate.
* For major service-impacting events, NetApp will notify the Customer Service Desk and Customer Portfolio manager by phone and email. The notification, and subsequent updates, will be in regard to any service.

=== Escalation Process

If you have an open case/ticket that needs to be escalated, please email mailto:keystone.escalations@netapp.com[keystone.escalations@netapp.com^] or call into the Keystone Support team and ask to speak to the tech lead or a KSDM. The NetApp KSM will coordinate with the tech lead or SDM will take responsibility for a problem resolution oversight and provide progress updates on a timely basis.

If a management escalation is required for an ongoing incident, the KSM provides a contact to request escalated support. As a general rule, all resources (or their delegates) are available 24/7 for NetApp Keystone storage escalations. If a resource is not available and does not respond within 15 minutes (severity 1) or 30 minutes (severity 2), the customer should work with the NetApp KSM to help with the required escalations and resolution. The escalation contact information is provided in the below table.
