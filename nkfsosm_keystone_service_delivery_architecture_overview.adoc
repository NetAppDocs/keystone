This section describes the NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription (Flex Subscription) infrastructure architecture and management application for the NetApp and customer-operated environments.

Flex Subscription infrastructure architecture, design, choice of technology, and component products reside solely with NetApp. NetApp reserves the rights to take the following actions:

* Select, substitute, or repurpose products.
* Refresh products with new technology when deemed appropriate.
* Increase or decrease capacity of the products to meet service requirements.
* Modify architecture, technology, and/or products to meet service requirements.

The Flex Subscription infrastructure includes multiple components:

* User interface (web portal) of NetApp Service Engine.
* Keystone APIs for integration.
* A Keystone service infrastructure. that includes storage controllers
* Tools to manage and operate the service such as OpsRamp, Active IQ, and Active IQ Unified Manager.

== NetApp Service Engine

You can use the NetApp Service Engine web portal to manage and monitor a NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription storage service in a NetApp, partner, or customer-operated model. The portal consists of the following features:

* A graphical interface (NetApp Service Engine web interface) that supports monitoring and simple storage provisioning.
* A set of Keystone REST APIs that allow more advanced setup and storage management actions.

The NetApp Service Engine portal is a single interface that allows customers to perform the following tasks:

* Subscription dashboard. View status of subscribed capacity and how much is being consumed.
* Storage provisioning. Workflows to create your NFS/CIFS file shares, FC/iSCSI disks, and S3 bucket.
* Data protection. Create snapshots and set backup policy or data replication on the provisioned file share or disk.
* Reports. View file shares and disks inventory and also trend on capacity usage against different service levels.
* Manage subscription. Order additional capacity to an existing subscription or a new service through the portal.
* Submit service requests or support issues and view their status

The complete functionality of NetApp Service Engine is available only in the NetApp-operated model. In a customer or partner-operated model, the NetApp Service Engine functionalities are limited to reporting and subscription management.
