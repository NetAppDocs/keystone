KFS offers capacity at predefined performance levels. Each Performance Service Level is defined by its I/O density, which is the ratio of performance (input/output operations per second [IOPS]) and used storage (TiB of stored data) which is IOPS/TiB.

Each volume within Keystone is associated with a performance service level. All I/O operations and all used storage used on the respective volume are factored into the volumeâ€™s I/O density calculation.

Figure 5 defines the performance service levels.

I/O density calculations at the volume level are reported to show peak I/O density during the prior week. The peak performance is determined on an hourly time interval. I/O density reports by volume are generated monthly to gauge adherence to the respective service levels.
